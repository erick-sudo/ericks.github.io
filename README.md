#### The old childhood warning “Stranger danger!” has withstood the test of time even in our modern, developed world.

Now that most of our daily procedures and activities are automatized and available for use on the Internet, we need to take the same level of precaution we did as children, crossing to the other side of the street whenever we saw a suspicious stranger. This precaution is needed even more after seeing some critical statistics surface, claiming that nearly one-third of the world’s computers are infected with some type of malware.
